Web Server linked with a SQL database for an E-commerce Website

Before running your code drag the "bin" folder into "M3" folder

This is a basic Web Server that is linked with SQL database for an E-Commerce Website with different type of users(Admin, Vendor, Customer, Delivery).
Each user's login page have different authorities in the Website.
You will find the ERP and E-ERP diagrams in the folder downloaded.

Feel free to customized the website according to your business, I prefer to use Visual Studio! (ASP.NET, C#)
Thank you for downloading this and I hope you enjoy the project
